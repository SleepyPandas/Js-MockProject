        <h1>About Us</h1><br>
        <p>Adorabits, an E-commerce Website, which is a Team Project for EECS 1012 - Fall 2023 - Section B - Lab 1.</p>
        <br>

        <h3>Project Description</h3>
        <p>The idea of this project is to simulate an e-commerce environment using JS, CSS and HTML. There are many
          avenues from a development standpoint that we can work towards. But the focus of this project will be
          providing or simulating a storefront from a consumer perspective, this means having a responsive and intuitive
          website, that is not only graphically appealing but is functionally sufficient for a given target audience.
          <br><br>
          Included may be features such as product listing, simulating cart functionality and its associated “checkout
          page” perhaps a search functionality, and a product catalogue among other features. However, as we get a
          deeper grasp of web development we can deliberate and consolidate a list of realistic functions in the
          timeframe given and that aligns with our individual and collaborative ability.</p><br><br>
        <h3>Some Features (adjusted for no server side) </h3>
        <p id="line-spacing1">
          <strong>Dynamic Content Handling:</strong> The code dynamically updates the content based on user
          interactions, such as adding items to the cart,
          adjusting quantities, and removing items.
          This creates a more interactive and engaging user experience. <br>
          <strong>LocalStorage Usage:</strong> The use of localStorage ensures that user data, such as the shopping cart
          items,
          persists even when the user navigates between different pages. <br>
          <strong>Cart Functionality:</strong> The shopping cart functionality is well-implemented, with features like
          updating the total price, removing items, and completing the purchase through a checkout button. <br>
          The <strong>"back to top"</strong> button utilizes smooth scrolling to enhance navigation back to the top of
          the page. <br>
