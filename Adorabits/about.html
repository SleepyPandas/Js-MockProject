       <h1>About Us</h1><br>
       <p>Adorabits, an E-commerce Website, which is a Team Project for EECS 1012 - Fall 2023 - Section B - Lab 1.</p><br>
       <h3>Team Members</h3>
       <p>Anthony Hua - 220019311 - anthon@my.yorku.ca - Section B - Lab 1.<br>

       <h3>Project Description</h3>
       <p>The idea of this project is to simulate an e-commerce environment using JS, CSS and HTML. There are many avenues from a development standpoint that we can work towards. But the focus of this project will be providing or simulating a storefront from a consumer perspective, this means having a responsive and intuitive website, that is not only graphically appealing but is functionally sufficient for a given target audience. <br><br>
          Included may be features such as product listing, simulating cart functionality and its associated “checkout page” perhaps a search functionality, and a product catalogue among other features. However, as we get a deeper grasp of web development we can deliberate and consolidate a list of realistic functions in the timeframe given and that aligns with our individual and collaborative ability.</p><br><br>
       <h3>Provided Functions</h3>
       <p>(1) Have a catalogue of 10-15 Items with 3-4 sub categories to select from e.g. the main catalogue says plushies, then there are 3 sub categories to choose from, say small, medium or large plushies.<br><br>
          (2) Search bar along with the categories mentioned in (1).<br><br>
          (3) There is a filter option, to filter via price, color, and other common attributes.<br><br>
          (4) Shopping Cart functionality displaying Total price, and allowing a “queue of products”.<br><br>
          (5) Simulate “stock levels” based upon order processing.<br><br>
          (6) Simulate checkout functionality allowing the user to input personal information.<br><br>
          (7) Payment integration using “sandbox accounts” or a simulated environment allowing the transferring of “fake” money similar to practice day trading applications.<br><br>
          (8) Customers can view the order details in the HTML page.<br><br>
          (9) After we having a real domain, our website security will be protected by Cloudflare, a free WAF protector.<br><br>
          (10) Must be functionally responsive and adaptive to not only desktop users, but mobile device users. <br><br>
          (11) Must be so undeniably appealing that it can be considered a work of art. </p>
